The founding of Google in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin marked a significant milestone in internet history. The company, which began as a research project at Stanford University, revolutionized web search with its PageRank algorithm. Initially operating from a garage in Menlo Park, Google quickly grew to become one of the world's most influential technology companies.

In 2004, Google launched Gmail, which transformed email services with its innovative features and large storage capacity. The same year, the company went public with its IPO, raising $1.67 billion. This event significantly impacted the tech industry and demonstrated the potential of internet-based businesses.

Google's acquisition of YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion represented a major shift in digital media consumption. YouTube, founded by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim in 2005, had quickly become the leading platform for online video sharing. The acquisition helped establish Google's dominance in digital advertising and content distribution.

The development of the Android operating system, which Google acquired in 2005, played a crucial role in the smartphone revolution. Android's release in 2008 challenged Apple's iOS and eventually became the world's most widely used mobile operating system. The Android Open Source Project, led by Google, fostered a vast ecosystem of mobile applications and devices.

In 2015, Google underwent a major restructuring, becoming a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. This reorganization, led by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, was designed to separate Google's core internet business from its other technology ventures. Sundar Pichai was appointed as Google's CEO, while Page became CEO of Alphabet.
